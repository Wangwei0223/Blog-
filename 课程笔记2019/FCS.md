1. even + even = 2n + 2m = 2(n + m) ====> even number
2. odd + odd  = (2n + 1) + (2n + 1) = 2(n + m + 1) even
3. even + odd = 2n + 2m + 1 = 2(n + m) + 1 odd
4. even * even = 2n*2m = 2(2nm) even

The multipcation principle (The product rule)

The collection of things can be separate tinto m different types, and if each of these types can be separate into k different subtypes.
Then there are mk different types in all;

Suppose that a proceduce can be broken down into a sequence of two tasks. If there are n1 ways to do the first task, and for each of these ways of doing the first task, there are n2 ways to do the second task, then there are n1*n2 ways to do the procedure.

Problem: The car lincense plates have letter, not numbers
BQJ or CCT and DWD

How many unique lincese plades are possible
26*26*26
no duplicate 26*25*24

Problem: If duplicates are allowed, how many lincese start with letter A
1*26*26
no duplicate 1*25*24

if no duplicate how many start with AA

doesnt begin with A
